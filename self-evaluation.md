# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method? 
There are some concepts that I don't understand, but I do understand the basics of the each method.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
I will admit I felt stressed during my research of finding a solution to challenge 2. I found myself experiencing both productive struggles and unproductive struggles.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I believe I need to go over the practice examples on the Mod0 website. If I continue to practice those, then I will have a better understanding of how to go about the each method.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I've had my questions answered already. When I do have questions, I first try to find a solution to my problem. Attempt some code in ruby, and if I cannot find a solution I then proceed to ask my small group mates.
